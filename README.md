# oauth

OAuth 2.0 is used basically everywhere. I use it literally every day, but I've only recently done a bit of research to figure out how it works under the hood. In this repo, I want to implement a basic oauth server and a simple cli client so I can get a better grasp of how it works.

This is also an excuse to learn more Rust.
